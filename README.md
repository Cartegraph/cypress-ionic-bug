# Cypress/Ionic Bug Reproduction

This reproduces buggy behavior with Cypress and Ionic's `<ion-content>` element. A number of Cypress tests are included, running against multiple setups, demonstrating an issue scrolling to and clicking on an offscreen button.

First start `npx ng serve`, then run `npx cypress open`.
